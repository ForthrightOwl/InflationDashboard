# InflationDashboard

The project contains a data folder and 2 python files.
Main.py file is an inflation analysis dashboard while data_generator.py updates the inflation data in the data folder from the bls API.
Main.py should work as is, data_generator.py will require an API key which you can obtain for free from: https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/

In the data folder data files are updated from the data_generator.py with the exception of the relative importance file. It has to be updated manually,
however new data is only released every December.
